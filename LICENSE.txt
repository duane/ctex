NAME
----

Because CTeX is not yet a program that conforms to the original TeX, it is
named "ctex" in the following ways:

  1. The github account that hosts the code was renamed to "ctex" in March of
  2012.
  2. The executable generated from the source code is "ctex", not "tex".
  3. In output DVI files, the program identifies itself as "CTeX".
  4. The project refers to itself as "CTeX" when referring to itself; any
  references to "tex" refer to either Donald Knuth's original program or to
  the algorithms the original program uses.
